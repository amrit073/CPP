	 2. Pokhara Kaski Gandaki 50000
	 3. Butwal Rupendehi Lumbini 100000
	 4. Dharan Sunsari Prov 1 80000
2. Write a Program defining an inline function to compute the area of circle with radius as input.
3. Write a program to get input a string and print the string and its reverse. Define your own
   function to reverse the string in your program.
4. Write a program overloading function sort() to sort an array of integers, characters as well as
   floating point numbers(Use any sorting algorithm).
5. Write a program using dynamic memory allocation to get input an array of numbers and find
   the sum of N numbers stored in the array using a function to compute the sum.
6. Write a program that uses a structure Distance with data members meter and centimeter.
   Encapsulate the structure with the input and output function as well as the function to add the
   two variables of Distance and return the sum. Your program should display the result.
7. Write program with objects as function argument by passing by value, passing by address and
   passing by reference defining a class Time with data member hour, minute, second as integers.
   Write member functions to read the data for objects and to show the value of objects of Time.
   Define a friend function addtime() with objects as arguments and return the sum of two
   objects. Show the values of each object and their sum as output.
8. Write a program defining the class Distance with data member feet and inch as integer.
   Overload the constructors along with copy constructor. Use the member functions for input and
   output as well as to compute the sum of the two objects and return the sum. Show read/write
   operations in main() using above information.
9. Write a program to increment the Time object of class Time with data member hour, min and
   sec by 1 second using operator overloading for increment ++ in pre-increment and post-
   increment form. Display the value of time before and after increment.
10. Write a program that uses a class Distance with data member feet and inches and another class
    String with data member a character string. Overload operator + to add the two object of
    Distance type as well as to concatenate the two object of String Type. Show the output of
    adding and concatenating.
11. Write a program defining a class matrix with data element as two dimensional matrix , row and
    col as integer. Define the member functions read() to read the value of matrices and show() to
    display the matrix objects. Overload the operator + to add two matrix objects and also overload
    the operator \* to multiply the two matrix objects. Input the two matrices object and compute
    sum and product of matrices using the operators and show the result.
12. Write a program using two classes Fahrenheit with data member f and Celsius with data
    member c. Overload the operator << and >> in both class to handle the input and output. Write
    the data conversion routine in Celsius class that converts the Fahrenheit into Celsius. Show your
    conversion result in main . [ formula: C =(F-32)*5/9]
13. Write a program that uses a function template for sorting the different data in an array. You can
    use any sorting algorithm in function template.
14. Write a program using class template to implement the stack with different data members
    integers/characters.
15. Write a program to read all text from a file and display in screen.
